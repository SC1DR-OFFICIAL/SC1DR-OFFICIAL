About Me
I am a developer with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, currently pursuing a Master's degree. I have completed several professional development programs, including C programming, Python programming, and retraining in Data Science and AI. I also completed a color correction course from Isaev's Workshop and am currently enrolled in an advanced Neural Network Developer course from The Founder online school.

Professional Background
I have three years of experience working at ProCamp, where I developed Telegram bots for various projects. Since school, I’ve been passionate about programming, particularly in Python, and I specialize in creating Telegram bots. One of my key projects is a bot developed for a well-known realtor in Tashkent, built using only standard Python libraries like requests, without relying on additional libraries like pytelegrambot.

Currently, I am interning at TERNEX, a software development company focused on network technologies.

Previous Experience
Before focusing solely on software development, I spent three years as a video editor and motion designer. I also completed a color correction course at Isaev's Workshop. After changes in the industry, I decided to pursue my long-standing passion for artificial intelligence.

Goals & Vision
My goal is to become a specialist capable of integrating AI solutions into business processes, no matter how complex. I’m particularly interested in working with android development in the future, as I believe these technologies will become mainstream in the coming decades.

Personal Interests
In my free time, I enjoy playing League of Legends, watching cartoons and anime, and following several streamers. I’m always open to new connections and conversations!
